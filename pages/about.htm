        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Through new and exciting projects I have developed my skills across a variety of languages and platforms such as JavaScript, C# and ActionScript. I grasp every opportunity to proactively learn and use new technologies. This self motivation and drive has lead me to progress from once a Graphic Designer to an Interactive Developer.</p>
        <p>My past Graphic design experience has allowed me to look at user experience and development approach in new ways.</p>
        <p>Over the past few years I have used the following frameworks: PixiJS, ThreeJS, Phaser, CreateJS, BackboneJS, RequireJS and many others. I also have experience with Flash, Adobe Air, Unity and Apache Cordova.</p>
